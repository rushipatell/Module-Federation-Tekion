As someone just starting out as a software engineer, I took on the task of transforming Tekion's payroll product from a monolithic to a micro-frontend architecture using Webpack's module federation plugin. This project was both exciting and challenging, especially given the delicacy of the task—any small mistake could have affected the entire product. After learning new technical concepts from courses and articles, I completed it in around four weeks. I consider this my greatest project because of its impact on consumers, its improvements to the user interface, and the steep learning curve I overcame.

I've attached the summary PDF I used for the KT session with my colleagues, as I’m unable to share the code directly here.
